        <p className="textAbout ">Hi, I am Colin Dsouza currently pursuing my Master's degree 
        in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston. I have worked for Zynga Games Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore for 
        3.5 years after completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2016. The agile practices in this 
        organization have transformed me into a confident engineer. My interest lies in owning responsibility in delivering 
        a system that uses solid backend technologies. However, I would like to consider myself as a reliable 
        engineer who doesn't restrict himself to any particular framework or technology, after all software development is 
        all about learning and evolving at a quick pace.</p>
